## Code for doing fast calculations


### Background
When I was very young I was good at math. 
I enjoyed solving difficult problems in clever ways that allowed for solutions much quicker than standard solutions would allow.
I didn't do much coding util I got a *real* job in the private sector working for the US government.
Working there for nearly twenty years, I actually did quite a bit of coding.
Starting with Perl and Python and working with C# and Java and then eventually things like Jupyter notebooks.
Throught this time I learned more and more about C and assembly and have fallen more and more in love with C.

### So What Now?
I'd like to keep this repository to store away some gems that took me a while to figure out.
